            <h2>My G-book program.</h2>
            <p>
                During this project I will think and design a Multi-device experience for a certain activity. I am thinking in particular of the user goals that are important before, during and after this activity, and which device would be most suitable at which stage. In three weeks (six lessons) I will choose a topic with a focus on Multi-device experiences and develop the necessary functionalities and interactions step by step into a detailed screenflow.

            <h4>The chosen idea</h4>

            <p>
                <strong>Program to learn how to draw a manga character.</strong>
                <br>I chose my first idea. An app that can make drawing a Manga character easier for the beginner artists, who want to learn but also create their own positions for their original characters. My focus is on the beginner artists to learn how to draw a manga character, because it is a different style from the other styles.

            <h4>Scenario & user requirements</h4>

            <p>
                My final screenplay was one with too many details, but it was very helpful to create my wirflow and my final screen flow. It was also clear to gather my user requirements.

            <h4>Job stories & screenflows</h4>

            <p>
                To learn how to build my flow, we chose three reguirements to create three Job stories. Then search for apps that use these features and create screenflows to learn from them.

            <h4>Wireflow</h4>

            <p>
                My wireflow was shorter than the end screenflow but the layout was good as a base. Clear manga style and content was good too. Of course I improved my work according to the feedbacks from the project, but some of the feedbacks I incorporated into my final work because the project time was short and busy with too much work.

            <h4>My Screenflows</h4>

            <p>
                For my screen design I made a Logo with a name of a manga drawing pen and manga book together to be named <strong>G-Book</strong>. It was a nice app for me as a drawing, anime and manga lover where I used the manga and comic style to have the final design. I am very happy with the end result and the flow it created, because it was fun to build a Program like this for me.
