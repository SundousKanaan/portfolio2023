            <h2>ISGA prototype.</h2>
            <p>
                This project was my first time to work individually and create something. I was nervous but after a while everything went well and I had my work online to test with my classmates. It took me a lot of time to write the code properly, because I was learning code in other subject at the same time.

            <h4>What is this project?</h4>
            <p>
                The project was to prototype a web app in correct HTML and CSS, containing the most important information of the ISGA (International Student Guide Amsterdam), so that the students can use the guide faster, easier and always.

            <h4>Research</h4>
            <p>
                To continue the work, we must first make a research about the book, its content, its style, its layout and interview international students, then collect the results.

            <h4>Improve</h4>
            <p>
                I'm happy with my all pages and how they work the way I want with no issues with clear images and the design I want. I could design my all pages according to my idea and improve according to the feedbacks, then I had my final version, which I am proud of. It was nice to see how my work improves through the project.

            <h4>The code</h4>
            <p>
                I was satisfied with my code because it was the first time to create many screens with one css file with different styles. It was a lot of work, but I also had good results, as a prototype.

                <p>
                    It was a long project with a lot of work, new knowledge and experiences, but in the end I had a nice result that can work fine.
