            <p>
                The mission was to enhance the user experience of MAAS coffee machines through comprehensive research on the machines, as well as different coffee or tea moments and alternatives. The outcome was a final poster highlighting the key findings from the research.

            <h4>Research results</h4>
            <p>
                After some user testing, watching interviews and doing some research, I found ten solutions to our user problems and made lo-fi sketches for that.

            <h4>End improve advice</h4>
            <p>
                In the end I chose to make my solution advice work with the machine system and explained the steps of the solution by designing a sequential design of the machine screen with the addition of adjustments.
                <br>Below is a screen where the user can determine how much sugar, coffee and milk is in his drink. There is also an indicator for calories and also two buttons to choose between coffee beans and powder. Of course everything works with touch.
