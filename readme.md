# Portofolio 2023

In my search for an internship for the upcoming academic year, I'm building a new portfolio. This time, I've created a virtual room that truly represents me. Though my actual room is small, I've imagined it on a larger scale. This virtual space showcases my style and serves as a digital portfolio to highlight my skills and best work from my studies. Come along as I bring this expanded room to life in code.
