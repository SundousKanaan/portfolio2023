# Portofolio 2023

In my search for an internship for the upcoming academic year, I'm building a new portfolio. This time, I've created a virtual room that truly represents me. Though my actual room is small, I've imagined it on a larger scale. This virtual space showcases my style and serves as a digital portfolio to highlight my skills and best work from my studies. Come along as I bring this expanded room to life in code.

# Sketches

Prior to diving into coding, I began by sketching out simple designs for the portfolio, envisioning how it would appear on both small and large screen devices. However, as I progressed with the coding process, certain aspects underwent changes. I discovered new and visually appealing ideas to incorporate, leading to adjustments in interaction style, appearance, and overall design. These modifications allowed for a more captivating and visually striking implementation of the portfolio.

    I selected the Digimon Calumon because it possesses a special connection to the Internet, assisting other Digimon with their digievolutions. This unique connection made it a fitting choice for the concept of loading. (and he is so cute)

# Cons
Due to time constraints, my room currently lacks smooth and clear accessibility. As this is my first experience creating a space in 3d space, I acknowledge that there is room for improvement in future iterations. Rest assured, I am committed to enhancing accessibility in my future works.
